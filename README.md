## Game Overview

- **Genre:** Tower Defense / Strategy  
- **Platform:** HTML5 (browser)  
- **Engine:** Godot  
- **Author:** ButWhyLevin  
- **Music:** Kevin MacLeod  
- **Jam:** Dozen Days Game Jam  

### Theme & Mechanics

The game incorporates the jam’s theme(s):

- **Duality (Day / Night):** Each tower has a function in day and night cycles — for example, a tower might be strong in daytime but weak at night (or vice versa).  
- **Decay / Zomboge:** There’s a “zomboge” concept — decay over time or zombie influence — that ties into tower performance or enemy types.  

These mechanics add strategy to when and how you place towers.
